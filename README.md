# MachineLearning with SKLearn

Project using the scikit-learn machine learning libraries to achieve static analysis and determination on a raw dataset provided by UNB.
Application uses both Decision Trees and Neural Network models to determine results. Results go through a confussion matrix and showcases the prediction accuracy aswell.
Pre-processing of the data has been applied on the raw datasets so that valid data passes through (data consisting integer values).
Memory optimization has also been applied so that the file can be read and used using the lowest data types possible.
